abstract = "Language learnability has been investigated. This refers to the following situation: A class of possible languages is specified, together with a method of presenting information to the learner about an unknown language, which is to be chosen from the class. The question is now asked, “Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language?” Many definitions of learnability are possible, but only the following is considered here: Time is quantized and has a finite starting time. At each time the learner receives a unit of information and is to make a guess as to the identity of the unknown language on the basis of the information received so far. This process continues forever. The class of languages will be considered learnable with respect to the specified method of information presentation if there is an algorithm that the learner can use to make his guesses, the algorithm having the following property: Given any language of the class, there is some finite time after which the guesses will all be the same and they will be correct. In this preliminary investigation, a language is taken to be a set of strings on some finite alphabet. The alphabet is the same for all languages of the class. Several variations of each of the following two basic methods of information presentation are investigated: A text for a language generates the strings of the language in any order such that every string of the language occurs at least once. An informant for a language tells whether a string is in the language, and chooses the strings in some order such that every string occurs at least once. It was found that the class of context-sensitive languages is learnable from an informant, but that not even the class of regular languages is learnable from a text."

Modal mu-calculus is a logic used extensively in certain areas of computer science and is of considerable intrinsic mathematical and logical interest. Its defining feature is the addition of inductive definitions to modal logic; thereby it achieves a great increase in expressive power and an equally great increase in difficulty of understanding. It includes many of the logics used in systems verification, and is quite straightforward to evaluate. It also provides one of the strongest examples of the connections between modal and temporal logics, automata theory, and the theory of games. It provides second-order expressive power sufficient to generalize the most common temporal logics, but is still decidable and has the finite model property. It raises many intriguing issues about the interface between modal logic, complexity theory, and automata theory. This chapter surveys a range of the questions and results about the modal mu-calculus and related logics. The logic is defined, some approaches to gaining an intuitive understanding of formulae are described, and the main theorem about the semantics is established. The modal mu-calculus has the tree model property and relates to some other temporal logics, to automata and to games."

The automaton processes sequences of elements in {\$}{\backslash}mathcal S{\$}. While processing the sequence, the automaton tests atomic relations, performs atomic operations of the structure {\$}{\backslash}mathcal S{\$}, and makes state transitions. In this setting, we study several problems such as closure properties, validation problem and emptiness problems. We investigate the dependence of deciding these problems on the underlying structures and the number of registers of our model of automata. Our investigation demonstrates that some of these properties are related to the existential first order fragments of the underlying structures.",

The approach is based on a combination of oracle-guided learning from examples, and constraint-based synthesis from components using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. Our approach is suitable for many applications, including as an aid to program understanding tasks such as deobfuscating malware. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing bit-manipulating programs and by deobfuscating programs.},
